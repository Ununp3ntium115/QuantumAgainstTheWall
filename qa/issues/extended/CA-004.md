# Weak Key Detection - Argon2 Salt Validation

**ID:** `CA-004`
**Severity:** HIGH
**Category:** cryptanalytic
**Reference:** RFC 9106

## Description

Argon2 must reject weak salts (too short, all-zero, low entropy) that reduce password security.

## Verification Method

Test rejection of: salts < 8 bytes, all-zero salts, repeated salts. Accept crypto-random salts >= 8 bytes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test script created in `tests/security/CA-004.rs`
- [ ] Test passes locally
- [ ] Test integrated into CI pipeline
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed

## Related Issues

- Part of Extended Security Test Suite (100 tests)
- See `qa/extended-security-tests.md` for full context

## How to Verify Remediation

```bash
# Run the specific test
cargo test CA-004 --release

# Or run with verification script
./tests/security/verify_CA-004.sh

# Check for PASS output
# Exit code 0 = test passed
# Exit code 1 = test failed
```
