# Cache-Timing Resistance - Rijndael S-Box Lookups

**ID:** `SC-003`
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Category:** side-channel
**Reference:** Osvik et al. Cache Attacks (2006)

## Description

AES implementation must not use table lookups that leak information via cache timing. Use AES-NI hardware acceleration or bitsliced software implementation.

## Verification Method

Verify dependency on aes crate which uses AES-NI when available, bitsliced otherwise. Run cache timing analysis with CacheGrind.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test script created in `tests/security/SC-003.rs`
- [ ] Test passes locally
- [ ] Test integrated into CI pipeline
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed

## Related Issues

- Part of Extended Security Test Suite (100 tests)
- See `qa/extended-security-tests.md` for full context

## How to Verify Remediation

```bash
# Run the specific test
cargo test SC-003 --release

# Or run with verification script
./tests/security/verify_SC-003.sh

# Check for PASS output
# Exit code 0 = test passed
# Exit code 1 = test failed
```
