# Power Analysis Resistance - Key-Dependent Branching

**ID:** `SC-004`
**Severity:** HIGH
**Category:** side-channel
**Reference:** FIPS 140-3 Section 4.5.3

## Description

Crypto operations must not contain conditional branches that depend on key material. This prevents differential power analysis (DPA) attacks.

## Verification Method

Static code analysis: grep for if/match statements on key variables in hot paths. No key-dependent branches allowed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test script created in `tests/security/SC-004.rs`
- [ ] Test passes locally
- [ ] Test integrated into CI pipeline
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed

## Related Issues

- Part of Extended Security Test Suite (100 tests)
- See `qa/extended-security-tests.md` for full context

## How to Verify Remediation

```bash
# Run the specific test
cargo test SC-004 --release

# Or run with verification script
./tests/security/verify_SC-004.sh

# Check for PASS output
# Exit code 0 = test passed
# Exit code 1 = test failed
```
