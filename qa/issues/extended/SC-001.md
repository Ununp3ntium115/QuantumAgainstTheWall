# Timing Attack Resistance - AES Operations

**ID:** `SC-001`
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Category:** side-channel
**Reference:** FIPS 140-3 IG 9.7, CWE-208

## Description

AES key schedule and round operations must have constant-time execution regardless of key/plaintext values. This prevents attackers from recovering keys via statistical timing analysis.

## Verification Method

Use dudect statistical timing test suite. Run 1M iterations comparing execution time for all-zero keys vs all-one keys. p-value must be > 0.05 (no statistically significant difference).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test script created in `tests/security/SC-001.rs`
- [ ] Test passes locally
- [ ] Test integrated into CI pipeline
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed

## Related Issues

- Part of Extended Security Test Suite (100 tests)
- See `qa/extended-security-tests.md` for full context

## How to Verify Remediation

```bash
# Run the specific test
cargo test SC-001 --release

# Or run with verification script
./tests/security/verify_SC-001.sh

# Check for PASS output
# Exit code 0 = test passed
# Exit code 1 = test failed
```
