# Timing Attack Resistance - Argon2 Password Verification

**ID:** `SC-002`
**Severity:** HIGH
**Category:** side-channel
**Reference:** CWE-208, OWASP A02:2021

## Description

Password verification must take constant time regardless of whether the password is correct or incorrect. This prevents timing-based password enumeration attacks.

## Verification Method

Generate 1000 samples each for correct and incorrect passwords. Perform statistical t-test. p-value > 0.05 required.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test script created in `tests/security/SC-002.rs`
- [ ] Test passes locally
- [ ] Test integrated into CI pipeline
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed

## Related Issues

- Part of Extended Security Test Suite (100 tests)
- See `qa/extended-security-tests.md` for full context

## How to Verify Remediation

```bash
# Run the specific test
cargo test SC-002 --release

# Or run with verification script
./tests/security/verify_SC-002.sh

# Check for PASS output
# Exit code 0 = test passed
# Exit code 1 = test failed
```
