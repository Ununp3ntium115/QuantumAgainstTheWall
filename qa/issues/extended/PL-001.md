# Padding Oracle Attack - AEAD AAD Validation

**ID:** `PL-001`
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Category:** protocol-attack
**Reference:** Rizzo & Duong (2010)

## Description

Decryption errors must not reveal which byte failed authentication, preventing adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks.

## Verification Method

Tamper with different ciphertext bytes. All failures must return identical generic error.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test script created in `tests/security/PL-001.rs`
- [ ] Test passes locally
- [ ] Test integrated into CI pipeline
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed

## Related Issues

- Part of Extended Security Test Suite (100 tests)
- See `qa/extended-security-tests.md` for full context

## How to Verify Remediation

```bash
# Run the specific test
cargo test PL-001 --release

# Or run with verification script
./tests/security/verify_PL-001.sh

# Check for PASS output
# Exit code 0 = test passed
# Exit code 1 = test failed
```
