# Electromagnetic Emanation (TEMPEST) - RNG Seeding

**ID:** `SC-005`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** side-channel
**Reference:** FIPS 140-3 Section 4.5.4

## Description

RNG must use sources that are resistant to electromagnetic (EM) emanation attacks. OS-provided entropy sources include EM countermeasures.

## Verification Method

Document that getrandom() on Linux/Windows includes hardware RNG with thermal noise and LRNG reseeding.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test script created in `tests/security/SC-005.rs`
- [ ] Test passes locally
- [ ] Test integrated into CI pipeline
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed

## Related Issues

- Part of Extended Security Test Suite (100 tests)
- See `qa/extended-security-tests.md` for full context

## How to Verify Remediation

```bash
# Run the specific test
cargo test SC-005 --release

# Or run with verification script
./tests/security/verify_SC-005.sh

# Check for PASS output
# Exit code 0 = test passed
# Exit code 1 = test failed
```
