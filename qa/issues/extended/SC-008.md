# Fault Injection - Glitch Attack Resistance

**ID:** `SC-008`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** side-channel
**Reference:** FIPS 140-3 IG 9.8

## Description

Critical checks (e.g., signature verification) must be redundant to prevent skip via voltage/clock glitching.

## Verification Method

Add duplicate verification with independent code paths. Test with fault injection simulator.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test script created in `tests/security/SC-008.rs`
- [ ] Test passes locally
- [ ] Test integrated into CI pipeline
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed

## Related Issues

- Part of Extended Security Test Suite (100 tests)
- See `qa/extended-security-tests.md` for full context

## How to Verify Remediation

```bash
# Run the specific test
cargo test SC-008 --release

# Or run with verification script
./tests/security/verify_SC-008.sh

# Check for PASS output
# Exit code 0 = test passed
# Exit code 1 = test failed
```
