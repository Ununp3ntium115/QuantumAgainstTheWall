# Downgrade Attack - Algorithm Negotiation

**ID:** `PL-002`
**Severity:** HIGH
**Category:** protocol-attack
**Reference:** BEAST, POODLE attacks

## Description

Encrypted data must authenticate the algorithm used, preventing attacker from forcing use of weak algorithms.

## Verification Method

Verify EncryptedData includes algorithm field. Test that tampering with algorithm causes auth failure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test script created in `tests/security/PL-002.rs`
- [ ] Test passes locally
- [ ] Test integrated into CI pipeline
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed

## Related Issues

- Part of Extended Security Test Suite (100 tests)
- See `qa/extended-security-tests.md` for full context

## How to Verify Remediation

```bash
# Run the specific test
cargo test PL-002 --release

# Or run with verification script
./tests/security/verify_PL-002.sh

# Check for PASS output
# Exit code 0 = test passed
# Exit code 1 = test failed
```
