# NIST SP 800-90B Entropy Assessment

**ID:** `RQ-001`
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Category:** randomness
**Reference:** NIST SP 800-90B

## Description

RNG output must pass NIST entropy assessment with min-entropy >= 7.85 bits/byte.

## Verification Method

Generate 1MB sample. Run ea_non_iid tool. Verify min-entropy > 7.85.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test script created in `tests/security/RQ-001.rs`
- [ ] Test passes locally
- [ ] Test integrated into CI pipeline
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed

## Related Issues

- Part of Extended Security Test Suite (100 tests)
- See `qa/extended-security-tests.md` for full context

## How to Verify Remediation

```bash
# Run the specific test
cargo test RQ-001 --release

# Or run with verification script
./tests/security/verify_RQ-001.sh

# Check for PASS output
# Exit code 0 = test passed
# Exit code 1 = test failed
```
