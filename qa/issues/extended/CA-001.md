# Birthday Bound Safety - GCM Nonce Collision

**ID:** `CA-001`
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Category:** cryptanalytic
**Reference:** Bhargavan & Leurent (2016)

## Description

AES-GCM must enforce nonce counter limit at 2^32 messages to prevent birthday bound collisions which allow authentication forgery.

## Verification Method

Test that NonceState returns NonceExhausted error at counter = 2^32. Verify no overflow wraps to zero.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test script created in `tests/security/CA-001.rs`
- [ ] Test passes locally
- [ ] Test integrated into CI pipeline
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed

## Related Issues

- Part of Extended Security Test Suite (100 tests)
- See `qa/extended-security-tests.md` for full context

## How to Verify Remediation

```bash
# Run the specific test
cargo test CA-001 --release

# Or run with verification script
./tests/security/verify_CA-001.sh

# Check for PASS output
# Exit code 0 = test passed
# Exit code 1 = test failed
```
