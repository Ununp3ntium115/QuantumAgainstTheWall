# Speculative Execution - Bounds Check Bypass

**ID:** `SC-007`
**Severity:** HIGH
**Category:** side-channel
**Reference:** CVE-2017-5753 (Spectre)

## Description

Array indexing in crypto code must not leak secrets via speculative execution (Spectre/Meltdown). Use bounds-checked access or constant-time indexing.

## Verification Method

Audit all array accesses in hot paths. Use .get() instead of [] for secret-dependent indices.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test script created in `tests/security/SC-007.rs`
- [ ] Test passes locally
- [ ] Test integrated into CI pipeline
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed

## Related Issues

- Part of Extended Security Test Suite (100 tests)
- See `qa/extended-security-tests.md` for full context

## How to Verify Remediation

```bash
# Run the specific test
cargo test SC-007 --release

# Or run with verification script
./tests/security/verify_SC-007.sh

# Check for PASS output
# Exit code 0 = test passed
# Exit code 1 = test failed
```
