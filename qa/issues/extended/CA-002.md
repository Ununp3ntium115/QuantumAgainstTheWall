# Length Extension Attack Resistance - KDF

**ID:** `CA-002`
**Severity:** HIGH
**Category:** cryptanalytic
**Reference:** Kelsey & Schneier (2005)

## Description

Key derivation must use HMAC-based construction immune to length extension attacks. SHA-256 alone is vulnerable.

## Verification Method

Verify HKDF implementation. Test that extending info parameter produces completely different keys.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test script created in `tests/security/CA-002.rs`
- [ ] Test passes locally
- [ ] Test integrated into CI pipeline
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed

## Related Issues

- Part of Extended Security Test Suite (100 tests)
- See `qa/extended-security-tests.md` for full context

## How to Verify Remediation

```bash
# Run the specific test
cargo test CA-002 --release

# Or run with verification script
./tests/security/verify_CA-002.sh

# Check for PASS output
# Exit code 0 = test passed
# Exit code 1 = test failed
```
